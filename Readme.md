# TextureViewer

This is a just a simple macOS app that lets you choose a png file and it renders it on a rotatable cube. It was created to aid in Minecraft resource pack creation by allowing you to quickly preview simple textures. I only spent an hour and a half whipping it together so it's pretty simple. Maybe later if someone else requests I can support block models using some code from DeltaCore or something.

If you find this actually useful feel free to make feature requests.

I might write it again in Rust just for fun to learn some more Rust.
